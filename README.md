## Doctor Api
The Doctor API provides endpoints to interact with doctor-related data in a healthcare system. It allows users to perform various operations such as retrieving a doctor's information by ID, adding a new doctor to the system, fetching a list of all doctors, updating doctor details, and deleting a doctor record. The API supports HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and returns appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of each operation. The requests and responses are in JSON format. The API provides a straightforward way to manage doctor information within the healthcare system.

## Patient Api
The Patient API provides endpoints to interact with patient data. It allows retrieving patient information, adding new patients, updating existing patient details, and deleting patients. The API supports the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

- GET /api/patient/{id} retrieves a specific patient's information based on the provided ID. It returns the patient's name, registration date, patient ID, email, phone number, date of birth, and gender.

- GET /api/patient/ retrieves a list of all patients. It returns an array of patient objects, each containing the patient's name, registration date, email, phone number, patient ID, gender, and date of birth.

- POST /api/patient/ creates a new patient. It requires the request body to include the patient's ID, name, date of birth, gender, phone number, email, and registration date. On success, it returns the newly created patient object.

- PUT /api/patient/{id} updates an existing patient's details based on the provided ID. The request body should include the patient's ID, name, date of birth, gender, phone number, email, and registration date. It returns the updated patient object.

- DELETE /api/patient/{id} deletes a patient based on the provided ID. It returns a success message confirming the deletion.

Ensure to include the appropriate HTTP status codes in the responses for successful operations (200 or 201) and error scenarios (404 or 400) to provide meaningful feedback to API consumers.
